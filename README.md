# NYC-Electricity-Consumption-and-Cost-Prediction

In New York City, pricing and usage of electricity are significant variables that have an impact on both residents and companies. New York City is one of the biggest and most populated cities in the world, making it a significant electricity consumer. For policymakers, utility corporations, and consumers alike, understanding how energy use and cost vary throughout various neighborhoods in the city can be quite insightful. In order to find patterns and trends in New York City's power consumption and cost data as well as investigate potential influences on these patterns, this project will analyze the data. Our objective is to give a thorough overview of New York City's electricity costs and consumption while also spotting chances for cost and energy savings.
